ContextInjection
CI is a simple dependency framework supported by SpecFLow
Can instantiate and inject an instance of a class into a scenario
It enables data sharing between two binding classes i.e. step definition classes that are used in different steps of the same scenario
To use CI we do the following
a. Create a POCO to hold the shared data
b. Within each binding class defined shared class as constructor parameter
c. Save the constructor parameter to an instance field in the binding classes so can be used in step definitions
